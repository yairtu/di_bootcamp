## Instructions:

Build a lesson page for the di-learning platform!

1. Create a directory called **leson1**


2. Inside the directory there should be 2 markdown files (.md) : in-this-chapter.md 
   and exercises.md. The first file in-this-chapter.md should contain a lesson of 
   your choice. The second file exercises.md should contain exercises 
   (it can be yours or it can be from the platform).

   * Hint: [Markdown Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo "Markdown Crash Course")
   * Check out [markdown documentation](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).


3. Create 2 routes:
* ```/exercises``` will render the exercises.md file
* ```/lesson``` will render the in-this-chapter.md file.

4. __BONUS__: Display the content of the md files in two different tabs in __one__ html file
